Following the link from the github to "processed data ready for use with scanpy" found mytself at this website (https://figshare.com/projects/Tabula_Muris_Senis/64982) then clicked procesesed files at the bottom and ran wget on the link to download all 5 files `wget https://figshare.com/ndownloader/articles/8273102/versions/3`. Then unzipped the files `unzip 3`
